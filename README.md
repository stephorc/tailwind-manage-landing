## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework.

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of Tailwind classes, including flex, positioning, and transitions.

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more. -->

### Continued development

I'd like to focus on improving my JavaScript abilites in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-property) - This was my first time using Tailwind, so I made good use of the docs when attempting to create transitions (etc.).
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69025067/how-can-i-use-span-to-create-a-burger-menu-in-css) - This question was really helpful to creating an interesting animated hamburger menu/icon.
